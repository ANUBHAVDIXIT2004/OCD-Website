# Welcome to OpenCode Developers Society of NIT Kurukshetra!
Our society is dedicated to fostering a vibrant community of passionate individuals interested in data structures and algorithms, as well as software development from NIT Kurukshetra. We engage in daily DSA question solving and discussions, CP discussions, and Development Projects providing a platform for members to enhance their problem-solving skills and learn from each other's approaches.  Our community is built on the principles of collaboration, innovation, and mutual growth, and we strive to create a supportive environment that encourages members to push their limits and explore new ideas.


## DSA
We focus on solving problems from various platforms such as LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, Coding Ninjas and more. Our members actively participate in daily problem-solving sessions, where we discuss and review each other's code. This allows for invaluable feedback and knowledge sharing among peers. We cover a wide range of topics, from basic data structures like arrays and linked lists to advanced topics like dynamic programming and graph theory. Our goal is to help members develop a strong foundation in DSA and prepare them for technical interviews and coding challenges.


## Competitive Programming
Our competitive programming group organizes regular contests and coding challenges, where members can participate and improve their coding skills. We conduct in-depth discussions on various solutions, and our members learn from each other's approaches. We believe that competitive programming is an essential aspect of a programmer's growth, and we provide a platform for members to participate in coding challenges and improve their skills. Our members have participated in various coding challenges and have achieved impressive results.


## Development
Our development initiatives are led by experienced seniors, who provide guidance and mentorship to our members. We believe in empowering our members to take ownership of their projects and provide a platform for them to explore new technologies and ideas. Our society takes great pride in the fact that the website is developed entirely by our own members. This demonstrates our commitment to hands-on experience and collaborative learning, ensuring that our members are well-equipped for real-world software development challenges. We have two major projects currently underway: NoterAI, an AI-based note-taking app, and CPMasters, a platform for competitive programmers. NoterAI aims to revolutionize the way students take notes, using AI-powered tools to summarize and organize notes. CPMasters is a platform that provides a comprehensive environment for competitive programmers, including features like code editor, problem sets, and leaderboards.


## Challenges and Initiatives
The society continuously introduces new challenges to keep the atmosphere dynamic and engaging. Our recent #30DaysOfJavaScript challenge saw an impressive participation of over 50 dedicated members. We also regularly host informative meetings, where our seniors generously share their knowledge and provide invaluable guidance
